# ballot-vote
A simple React app for choosing a candidate on a ballot.

You've been tasked with making an election ballot in React!

## Setup
From your challenges directory, run the following:

```
$ et get react-quiz
$ cd react-quiz
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec ruby server.rb
```

Then in another terminal tab run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Requirements
1. Using React and the data supplied in `react/src/constants/data.js`, render a
     static page displaying the election and cadidates. **You may not
     modify the data in this file**.

2. Clicking on a candidate updates the page to display the candidate's name at the
     top of the ballot.

3. Clicking on a different candidate updates the page to display that candidate's name top of the ballot.
